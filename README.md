Mario Forever: Party Worlds Reimagined is a remake of Mario Forever: Party Worlds created by LooPeR231 Featuring 10 worlds of varying design and interesting new mechanics. This is a public repository that not only contains the entire `.godot` project of the game, but also features all `.rdw` files for maps for analyzing and understanding how the game was made.

## Important note
When you first launch the `.godot` project, some parsing errors might appear. **This is normal,** You have to reload your project again and it will be ready to go.
